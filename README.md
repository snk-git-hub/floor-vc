# floor-vc
The Floor VC is an online virtual platform where people can meet, talk, and collaborate inside an interactive digital world.
Think of it like Slack or Discord, but instead of just chatting in channels, you actually move around in a virtual space — like a virtual office, café, or meeting hall — and interact with others naturally, as if you’re in the same place.
